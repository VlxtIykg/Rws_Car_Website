## A practise website on
### Responsive Web Design
### Flexbox manipulation
### Jquery draggable and droppable
### Keyframes
### Media queries for different sizes
----
## The above are the few following features I'm doing and practising but there may be potential in other things like
### Bootstrap? Notion/Notion api usage? Database usage? Supply and demand for cars to be changed? Change client likelyhood with amount of customers/purchasers based on irl automobile shop? Hoping to make responsive web layouts with flex and what not with less static units or more auto rws such as % units or flex.
